- **Tests :)**

The OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow is primarily aimed at server to server authentication and is characterized by the absence of a *user* principal. 

**OAuth2ServerConfiguration** contains the configuration for the Authorization Server and Resource Server.

Run the test to retrieve a token and call the protected REST endpoint.
